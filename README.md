# Easy Buttons

The plugin generates standardized buttons archetypes based on your choiches. It could generate them starting from existing styles, or by automatically generating them.

It is possible to define corner radius, and different types of buttons (text only, icon only, icon with text).

This plugin is intended as an educational plugin, as it shows how to handle Smart Layout and propose naming conventions for Symbols and Styles.
